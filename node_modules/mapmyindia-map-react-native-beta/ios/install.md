# iOS Installation

## Using CocoaPods

To install with CocoaPods, add the following to your  `Podfile`:

```
  # MapmyIndia
  pod 'mapmyIndia-maps-gl', :path => '../node_modules/mapmyindia-map-react-native-beta'

  # Make also sure you have use_frameworks! enabled
  use_frameworks!

```

Then run  `pod install`  and rebuild your project.

If you cannot use  `use_frameworks!`  for some reason, please see our workaround -  [https://github.com/react-native-mapbox-gl/maps/pull/714](https://github.com/react-native-mapbox-gl/maps/pull/714)

## React-Native >  `0.60.0`

If you are using autolinking feature introduced in React-Native  `0.60.0`  you do not need any additional steps.
